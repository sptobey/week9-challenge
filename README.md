# Original: Github
I mis-read the directions: "It should not be the same one you used last week" -- I thought this meant the API, not the repository....  So I used a new, different API rather than the previous one at: http://sptobey.github.io/week7-challenge/ (repo: https://github.com/sptobey/week7-challenge).
